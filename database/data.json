Today, it is over 2000 sq ft and houses a family of 3 (2 parents, 1 kid). This difference and other factors has helped create a widening gap between the haves and have-nots: Those who can afford a new home live like kings. Those who can't may be perpetually one paycheck away from homelessness. Most of the financing instruments we have are aimed at single family suburban homes designed to meet the needs of a 1950's-style nuclear family. Meanwhile, our demographics have changed and very few people fit that bill. The housing industry has been terribly slow to adapt to the changing needs of our changing demographics.Also, historically, it was more common to live with extended family. This was more manageable back when more than half the American population lived and worked on a farm. You could always put someone to work on the farm to help cover the cost of feeding and housing them. But a more city-centric lifestyle means that if you have no job, you typically aren't viewed as a contributing member of the household and it is much harder for people to extend generosity in that regard unless they are truly wealthy. We also had more SRO housing and boarding houses -- just the sort of supportive environment that the Murray's of the world seem to need. This was part and parcel of the culture and was not considered some kind of \"special service\" for problem individuals who couldn't adapt. It was also cheaper than a stand-alone apartment. Apartments designed for a nuclear family or houses designed for a nuclear family make up the majority of housing stock in the US and it is financially out of reach for many single individuals. College students often get multiple roommates to make it work but it really isn't designed to work for them. The Murray's of the world lack the ability to force the current housing situation to serve them adequately and mostly don't have other options which did exist not that many decades ago.I have a lot more thoughts and information on the subject but I don't care to beat it to death. The current housing situation really is a factor in why homelessness has been on the rise in recent years. Yes, it is one of many. But I don't think it can be lightly dismissed.","parent":1584536,"salty_score":0.9633,"ranking":670},{"id":4889323,"by":"Mz","author":"Mz","time":1354915543,"time_ts":1354915543000,"text":"Sorry. There is no intent to be evasive.The thing I am reacting negatively to is not the current laws concerning smoking but specifically the public announcement that they will only issues warnings. That is practically an invitation to people who want to be defiant assholes to do whatever they want.Laws are merely one tool for trying to keep the peace. And the reality is that if you actually have to enforce the law (overly much), you have already kind of failed. I struggle with how to say this clearly, because any sweeping statement is going to be wrong and invite attack and a lot of people are very uncomfortable with how things actually work. But, basically, you announce what is illegal knowing some people will politely do as they are told and then you put in place just enough consequences to act as a deterent to folks who are less inclined to simply do as they are told. Of course, some people will break the law for various reasons. Either they didn't know or it is a poorly designed law that is nearly impossible to obey or...whatever. However if things are done right, there will only be a moderate need for active enforcement. But an announcement like this amounts to a public invitation to do as you please. Some people will do it just because of this invitation, just like some seventeen year olds with college ID's will drink because some places will take a college ID at the door. It is a loophole and some people will take childish glee in that space where it kind of is forbidden but really is not.That is the piece I hope California handles better. I also hope that the fact that there is medical marijuana here already will help prevent the \"must get drunk on my 21st birthday\" style of reaction that you so often see when things finally get legalized. I believe that drugs and alcohol tend to attract people who somehow benefit physically. In California, if you really need marijuana and can prove it, it is already legal. Folks who are merely recreational users are going to be less rabid about wanting to fight for and exercise their right to toke. I think it is the people who strongly benefit (medically in some way) who are the most vehement. And those people are mostly already okay to smoke it here.

Symptom management is the name of the game.\" In other words, doctors were all too happy to consign me to a slow and torturous death.Since doctors were not helping me and I had largely been on my own in dealing with my health already, I continued working on the problem myself. I gradually got healthier by throwing out all my worldly possessions in order to break the cycle of contamination (this piece is heavily objected to by other folks who are dying of cystic fibrosis) and I did enormous research into what nutritional deficiencies I had, how to effectively treat them, and so on. I made drastic dietary and lifestyle changes.I have a diagnosis of a genetic disorder with a life expectancy of around 36 or 37. I will be 46 in one month.

A high percentage of people on the street have either medical or mental health issues. Many of them are self medicating with drugs or alcohol. Society as a whole needs to come up with better solutions, but, while waiting for those solutions, cops still need to protect the public from sometimes irrational behaviour.

When I was woke up, it was very aggressive because he was looking for a violent man and prepared for the worst. When he saw who I was, he said \"Oh, it's you. I know who you are.

There's a tradition in most northern European countries of strong central government. And the growth of technology in the 19c made it possible for a hands-on central government to be very much more hands-on.

When you said \"But now, when it supposedly happens for a sixth time, it's our fault.\", I got the impression that you're asserting the only reason why we correlate extinctions with human activity is because we want to blame humans.However, what's actually going on is more a collection of thousands of observations about these events, made on a case by case basis. For example, these are observations about human settlements impacting wildlife. In another area, they might be data about the results of us restructuring local flora and fauna. Or they might be analytical results pointing to correlations between human-induced contamination of water bodies and changes in the biome that characteristically follow it.

The environmental protection movement makes the same assertion, only about letting industry and agriculture go unchecked.But let's move away from political formulas now. The reality of the fact is that it actually matters very little whether and how often the Anthropocene is publicly declared. We're going to continue on the path we're already on. There will be some continued wide-scale destruction, and a lot of it will not be happening in western countries. But we'll also ramp up initiatives to try and lessen our environmental impact, both to preserve biodiversity for its own sake, but also to improve our own quality of life.You say that you believe any such efforts will harm people, but to be honest I find that line of reasoning difficult to follow, especially considering the fact that we're mortally dependent on the integrity of our biosphere and that the measures we're putting in place are generally very modest.None of this will change because some scientists make sensationalistic claims in the media.

Sure, the galaxies traveling on this expanding medium are not actually speeding apart powered by classical movement, but they are nevertheless changing position relative to one another in an interesting way.In fact, what we're interested in when we talk about FTL is not classical movement at all - what we want is to change positions instead. There are places in nature where we know this is happening right now, for example we do know space can \"flow\" faster than the speed of light on the far side of event horizons.So if we abandon the idea that we need to accelerate towards a destination, FTL becomes a broader idea of manipulating spacetime in order to be somewhere in less time than if we had actually flown there at the speed of light. There exist proposals for propulsion systems that go in this direction, for example the \"warp drive\" ideas that cheat by simply shortening the amount of space a vessel has to travel through. Some of these concepts seem to work in theory, for some definition of work.The trouble with all these ideas is they need impractical amounts of energy. Which is wasteful, since we only need to bend spacetime for a short while and then return it to its original state behind us, something that works analogous to a catalyst would be much better.At the most fundamental level though, what we are missing is a way of hacking spacetime. Huge masses and energies are how nature bends it, but ideally we would need some other way of manipulating the fabric of existence directly. This is the reason why drive systems in science fiction all have some kind of yet-unknown mystery substance critical to their function. Given how little we actually know about the basic fabric of the universe, ways of doing these manipulations may well exist. They might not. We most likely won't find out for centuries, if ever.Until then, we must answer the question so that yes, FTL is most likely possible in theory, but it's not even remotely within our grasp right now. It might never work in practice.Another observation worth considering: cosmic travel times seem utterly problematic right now because we individually live for extremely short periods of time. Spending a few thousand years in transit is much less worrisome if you're, say, an autonomous machine carrying an AI through the galaxy.","parent":8615224,"salty_score":0.5759,"ranking":199},{"id":2914402,"by":"Udo","author":"Udo","time":1314051962,"time_ts":1314051962000,"text":"Alright, I promise I will check it out.

Copying my brain won't copy my conscious self.... is a notion that I think is based on faulty assumptions. I've been trying to address why I believe this is only intuitively right but physically wrong in like 10 posts all over here against pretty much anyone who cared to comment, without a single voice of support.I recognize I'm alone in this. I get this means I'm likely wrong about this, and you're right in some way to assume that I just don't understand (or to quote an email: don't have the mental capacity nor the education required to understand).I don't understand how, once you introduce the concept of making an adequate copy, that still means there is an \"original\" and a \"copy\" which somehow isn't another instance of the original. I don't understand why the concept of making a copy is fine when we're talking about, say, a piece of text but then immediately seizes to be valid when we're talking about minds.Collectively, you guys tried to make me understand by invoking several things. For example, the argument was raised that because you obviously can't have several instances of your consciousness at the same time, this can never work. There was the argument that any would-be left-over physical body somehow remains the home of the mind, and there would obviously be an impostor around pretending to be me but ultimately not being me. At two points, it was suggested that I (specifically, I, Udo) be killed to prove that I care about my existence and the existence of forks based on me, which I do and which does not really have any meaningful connection to the question of the feasibility of copying. I also said that the \"problem\" of the left-over body most likely won't arise due to technical limitations of the process. Still, that didn't count and people still think that uploading minds is like building pyramids. Finally, the argument was made that both instances are by necessity different, if only because they occupy a different positions in space, to which I tried to explain that, yes, they're different and they'll continue to become more different over time, and yet that doesn't have any real bearing on the proposed possibility or impossibility of the whole concept.This is where I apologize and withdraw from the discussion. You certainly tried to explain it harder than most people here, but in the end that didn't work out. I'm old enough to have the strong feeling that at some point in the future, a populist Kurzweil 2.0 will come along and everybody will just come around to this conclusion as if it had just been invented.And that's fine with me. I don't need to be right, but I do want to have the option of being uploaded. Repulsion to the very idea is deeply ingrained within our society. Attempts to prolong life are virtually unknown outside horror literature where it's always portrayed as monstrous. Even \"progressive\" sites such as io9 draw the line here. It goes against the foundation of most religions, and it contradicts the intuition of most people.Of all things, a Buffy quote comes to mind here, allow me to paraphrase it: \"You'll live again, but it won't be you. A demon sets up in your body, having your memories and thinking your thoughts, but you'll be gone.\" - I think this sums up the opinion of most people when it comes to transhumanism.

What can be deduced about your device's make\/model\/revision from things like HTML feature support?

I know of many holiday properties where each individual apartment is privately owned, but the building is managed by a single entity. The owners wear the depreciation costs and interest charges (if using borrowed money) but get to keep the majority of the revenue from rentals, and any capital appreciation from the property, or wear any losses from a drop in value.In the same way, a startup can allow others to contribute the capital value, wear any depreciation, financing and insurance, and just take an agency fee. This is really not much different to other rental car companies who presumably lease all of the rental vehicles either off some central owner of the vehicles, or directly from the manufacturer. Or, perhaps they just have a large, revolving credit line which they use to purchase the vehicles. They certainly aren't going to own them, so it really comes down to a definition of title.I think the blurring here is that most people see car ownership as a strictly private-use phenomonen, whereas in property or boats, mixed private\/investment or pure investment is much more common.","parent":2110751,"salty_score":0.9895,"ranking":284},{"id":1990322,"by":"brc","author":"brc","time":1291948437,"time_ts":1291948437000,"text":"If you have a relatively stable income, when the economy is at its lowest ebb is the best time to borrow money and invest.

Quoting the Wikipedia article on the Medawar theory of ageing: \"Nature is a highly competitive place, and almost all animals in nature die before they attain old age. Therefore, there is not much motivation to keep the body fit for the long haul - not much selection pressure for traits that would maintain viability past the time when most animals would be dead anyway, killed by predators or disease or by accident.\" This is particularly true for men, who were (and still are, to an extent) usually doing more dangerous jobs than women. Thus, they die from accidents or predation earlier, so there is less selective pressure for genes that promote healthy organs in old age.Another possible scenario: there is more variation in male traits than in females, and age is more than linearly dependent on these traits. Thus, even if E[X] is the same for males and females, for some trait X, the average age E[X^n] will be lower for males.Evolutionary biology is full of reasonable-sounding explanations for just about anything.

It works well but is very annoying to configure: the primary configuration mechanism is a Windows program, but I run linux, so that just pisses me off.

The configuration is a very leaky abstraction, with further pisses me off.* For the switch(es), you definitely want a \"small business\" managed switch ($500 and up) that supports RMON\/SNMP. (We have some old Linksys\/Cisco \"managed\" switches with no RMON - cannot tell me where my traffic is going - and can only be configured with IE 7 or older(!!!)

If you only have one AP, this is overkill... we have several of them to cover our facility. The system is very reasonable and the central management is very very convenient. The primary interface to the software is Flash (ugh) - but it works well enough. There are other ways of interacting with the controller, but I have not much that way (I have written some MongoDB scripts to extract useful information nightly).* You are also going to need DHCP, DNS, etc. Windows Server with Active Directory is dominant at businesses.

Back in the days of nuclear winter, computer models were invoked to add weight to a conclusion: \"These results are derived with the help of a computer model.\" But now large-scale computer models are seen as generating data in themselves. No longer are models judged by how well they reproduce data from the real world -- increasingly, models provide the data. As if they were themselves a reality. And indeed they are, when we are projecting forward. There can be no observational data about the year 2100. There are only model runs.This fascination with computer models is something I understand very well. Richard Feynman called it a disease....I'd add that I read the TAPPS paper when it came out (back before I gave up on the AAAS) and followed the debate closely: one of the many reasons that paper was fatally flawed was that it used a one dimensional model of the atmosphere and planet, i.e. particles could go up and down, but there were no winds, no oceans, etc. People in the field said such models were notorious for being easily overbalanced by inappropriate inputs, which were of course another problem with the paper, one I could personally confirm (having been a nuclear war survivalist since 2nd grade in 1969).When LLNL did 3D modelling, their results said, yeah, maybe a nuclear fall, but that's it. Which comports with the observed effects of volcanic eruptions, which we have a lot of data on. I.e. the bottom line in simplest terms is \"earth big, humans small\".ADDED: just remembered that Feynman was there at the dawn of computerized scientific models, back when \"computers\" were the operators of calculators. Some of the necessary scientific inputs into creating the bomb could not be solved, only approximated, and they used a bunch of computers as they were called then and the current state of the art electro-mechanical calculator.

It was beyond the parameter they were establishing, and was prompted by Doolittle's raid and their ceaseless attempts to engage the US Navy in a \"decisive battle\". It resulted in something like temporary parity in naval power (i.e. carriers), and due to institutional failures they never recovered from their losses in trained pilots, Midway, before, and after (e.g. they didn't rotate experienced airmen back home to train new ones, they for the most part fought until they died).Our landing in Guadalcanal and their failure to quickly snuff it is where they lost the initiative, that attacked and started to unravel their real parameter. Otherwise we'd have stayed on the defensive until enough new carriers and supporting ships and planes were built, then we would have done a much bloodier and somewhat more prolonged sole advance through the Central Pacific, which would no doubt have had even more adverse consequences.Instead, they and we got into a knife fight in the Southwest Pacific, the Solomons and New Guinea, where both our carrier forces were essentially used up (of our serious fleet carriers only the Enterprise and Saratoga survived, and during this campaign the Saratoga got torpedoed and had to retire for a while for repairs, the Enterprise required serious stateside maintenance and refit while a British carrier covered for her).Japan and the Allies were pretty evenly matched on paper, and this campaign was brutal in every way, we lost 40+ ships (and two Real Admirals (2 stars) in one night action), they lost 50+, and a slow war of attrition was waged in the skies. I'm reading Fire in the Sky (http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Fire-In-The-Sky-Pacific\/dp\/0813338697\/) right now, which covers that in immense detail, e.g. one of the many reasons the Japanese lost was subpar civil engineering (in general their non-combat specialties didn't get any respect, this critically included intelligence), they didn't keep the taxiways between revetments and runways free of soft spots, resulting in lots of operational losses at critical time (on both sides, this operational losses destroyed more planes than combat)).Industrially and institutionally they couldn't complete well, and when our 2nd generation of planes and ships came on-line, with adequately trained air crews, maintenance staff, the Japanese in comparison were \"used up\", and were never a serious threat in the air until they resorted to kamikaze attacks.","parent":7815435,"salty_score":-1.0605,"ranking":415},{"id":7247651,"by":"hga","author":"hga","time":1392559503,"time_ts":1392559503000,"text":"See my other comment on starting with \"published and studied systems that are thought to be correct\".

In a slightly different domain, I saw this back when I was doing NT programming in the '90s. From the start it provided threads and plenty of thread safe stuff (and plenty not, including the MCV++ Standard Template Library in 1997, although that was mostly of an initial botch of the port from the HP? code), and this made quite a difference compared to trying to write threaded programs for UNIX(TM).If you're not going to limit yourself to copying paradigms like the Actor model I argue you're going to be in for a world of hurt, even as your ecosystem matures, because you'll almost certainly have non-thread safe stuff from the days when the community wasn't considering threading.So all I'm saying in this argument is that Common Lisp is traversing this painful path, and will never be as optimal as it might be, because when it was cast into concrete in 1984 threads weren't part of it.The Clojure argument for standard data structure syntax-literals, and strict limits on reader macros, is indeed legibility, defined as portability between humans. I think it's an issue, but one that I think we'll have to agree to disagree on. Although I don't see gaining CL compatibility as a goal, the foundations of the languages are too different (functional vs. multiparadigm including but not limited to functional).I agree that age itself isn't a good criticism, I was pointing out how Common Lisp's extreme age has resulted in issues, and \"age criticisms\" could be interpreted that way.This goes all the way back all the way to the very first late '50s LISP, e.g. while I personally like them, classic examples are Contents of the Address Register and Contents of the Decrement Register (car and cdr) of the vacuum tube IBM 704. More consequential are things like Lisp-2 vs. Lisp-1; maybe it's just a matter of taste and not having written enough macros in my career but I prefer the latter.Hmmm, to sum up, one argument for Clojure is that we now known enough to create a more restrictive dialect and benefit from the good taste of Rick Hickey and now others who are helping to carry the language's torch. Callow youth though he might be, mrottenkolber is spot on when he says it's an opinionated language, and that'll certainly mean among other things that it'll not be to many experienced Lisper's taste (probably easier if you're a Schemer, though).I harp on SMP programming because I find it, and the functional programming solutions to it, very interesting, not to mention it's just plain better for writing robust software.
